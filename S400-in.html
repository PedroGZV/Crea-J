		<h3>Advantages of this product</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>All at a glance:</b> good size functional LCD display and ten lines.

In addition, using a scanner to register products speeds up the process and prevents possible errors during manual entry. The CASIO register recognizes EAN13 / EAN8 / UPCA codes</li>

<li><b>Fast and silent:</b> a station printer.
